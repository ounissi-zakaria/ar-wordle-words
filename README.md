This program reads list of words downloaded from wikitionary, removes "harakat", keeps only one type of "alif" and removes all non 5 letter arabic words.

This program is a part of and a preparation for another project (Arabic wordle).

# Usage
Download the list of arabic words from [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/arabic-wordlist/), and extract it here.

Then you can run `process.py` to get the list of all 5 letter words in the file `5-letter-ar-words.txt`.
